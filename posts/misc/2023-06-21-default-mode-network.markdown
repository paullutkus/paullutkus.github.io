I've always been fascinated by the default mode network (DMN) due to its 
apparent role in our subjective experience of day-to-day life. I'd like to use 
this post to  collect various interesting papers related to the DMN.

### 1. Unhappiness, rumination, and the DMN ###

This paper by Yangmei Luo et al. is titled [<i>Resting-state functional
connectivity of the default mode network associated with happiness</i>](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fscan%2Fnsv132)
[@LuoDMN2015], and it purports to show that unhappy individuals have higher 
functional connectivity in the default mode network which leads to excess 
rumination. I've heard this jokingly referred to as the "thinking to 
depression pipeline."

### 2. On an optimistic note... ###

This next paper, by Kathleen Garrison et al., is about the effect of a certain
type of meditation on the default mode network. Its title is [<i>Meditation
leads to reduced default mode network activity beyond an active task</i>](https://doi.org/10.3758%2Fs13415-015-0358-3)
[@GarrisonDMN2015].
The subjects of this paper were specialists in Theraveda meditation, and they
were found to experience decreased DMN activity when performing tasks as
compared to the control group. Why compare brain activity during performance 
of a task? It seems that meditators enter a different state during 
rest (i.e. when not performing a task) than the general population -- 
making resting  DMN activity hard to compare. 

### 3. Mindfulness and the DMN ###

[<i>Mindfulness meditation increases default mode, salience, and central
executive network connectivity</i>](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17325-6)
[@BremerDMN2022],
by Benno Bremer et al., concludes that one month of mindfulness meditation leads to a sort of balance between the central executive network (a brain 
network related to problem solving and working memory), and the DMN.
