[[<b><i>7/12/23 </i></b>]&nbsp;]{.journalDate} Formulating the problem of 
finding the 
[largest convex subset](/posts/math/2023-07-09-largest-convex-subset.html) 
(in a way that can be computed) is difficult in general, and I think
that limiting the subsets to a certain shape could make things easier.

$n$-ellipses, ellipses with $n$ focal points, are always convex, and versatile 
as $n$ varies.

The resources I intend to use are:

1. [<b>Semidefinite Representations of The <i>K</i>-Ellipse</b> -- Nie, Parillo, and Sturmfels](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~njw/PUBLICPAPERS/kellipse_imaproc_toappear.pdf)
2. [<b>The Geometry of Semidefinite Programming</b> -- Sturmfels](https://aimath.org/WWN/convexalggeom/AIM.pdf)
3. [<b>On the Approximation of Convex, Closed Plane Curves by Multifocal Ellipses</b> -- Erd&ouml;s, Vincze](https://web.archive.org/web/20160928200222/http://renyi.mta.hu/~p_erdos/1982-18.pdf)
4. [<b>n-Ellipses and the Minimum Distance Sum Problem</b> -- Sekino](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/MISC/LA-BIBLIO/trunk/nellipse.pdf)

The item by Erd&ouml;s is exactly what I'm looking for and it suggests that 
$n$-ellipses might be able to approximate any convex, closed plane curve.
