[[<b><i>7/12/23 </i></b>]&nbsp;]{.journalDate} Formulating the problem of 
finding the 
[largest convex subset](/posts/math/2023-07-09-largest-convex-subset.html) 
(in a way that can be computed) is difficult in general, and I think
that limiting the subsets to a certain shape could make things easier.

$n$-ellipses, ellipses with $n$ focal points, are always convex, and versatile 
as $n$ varies.
