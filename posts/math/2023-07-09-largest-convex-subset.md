# [Introduction]{.underline} # 

Consider a closed, nonconvex figure in the plane. What is its largest convex 
subset? This does seem like a well founded question, and the problem as a 
whole can be used as a model for exploration as I'll discuss.

[<b>Figure 1</b>](#fig1) illustrates the question at hand. The amoeba shape is 
the nonconvex set in question, and the shaded triangle is a guess at the 
largest convex subset. Don't look to closely though, it's easy to pick out ways 
in which the triangular estimation can be improved. For instance, the bottom and 
left sides should be flush with the amoeba, and the right side of the triangle 
should also be pushed further until it's flush ([<b>Figure 2</b>](#fig2)).
