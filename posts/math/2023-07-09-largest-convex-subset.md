# [Introduction]{.underline} # 

Consider a closed, nonconvex figure in the plane. What is its largest convex 
subset? This does seem like a well founded question, and the problem as a 
whole can be used as a model for exploration as I'll discuss.

<b>Figure 1</b> illustrates the question at hand. The amoeba shape is 
nonconvex set in question, and the shaded triangle is a guess at the largest 
convex subset. Don't look to closely though, its easy to pick out ways in which 
the triangle estimation can be improved. For instance, the bottom and left 
sides should be flush with the amoeba, and the right side of the triangle should also be pushed further until it's flush (<b>Figure 2</b>)
